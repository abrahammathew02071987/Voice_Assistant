VOICE ASSISTANT - JARVIS

""")
st.markdown("""**Artificial Intelligence when used with machines, it shows us the capability of
thinking like humans. In this, a computer system is designed in such a way that typically
requires interaction from human. As we know Python is an emerging language so it
becomes easy to write a script for Voice Assistant in Python. The instructions for the
assistant can be handled as per the requirement of user. Speech recognition is the Alexa,
Siri, etc. In Python there is an API called Speech Recognition which allows us to
convert speech into text. It was an interesting task to make my own assistant. It became
easier to send emails without typing any word, Searching on Google without opening
the browser, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music, opening your
favorite IDE with the help of a single voice command. In the current scenario,
advancement in technologies are such that they can perform any task with same
effectiveness or can say more effectively than us. By making this project, I realized that
the concept of AI in every field is decreasing human effort and saving time. Inspired by Marvel's Iron Man**.""")
